Homebuilt
==========

The use of the software is not limited to comercial Bruker devices. Many
features can work better on homebuilt system. However, this software does not 
come with the required python interfaces for homebuilt systems ready built.
Except for Andrin Doll style spectrometers which are included as an example. 

For many homebuilt spectrometers, especially MATLAB based system, the design 
and implemntation of an interface should be very quick. For the Doll style
systems it took less than one day.

Please feel free to contact the development team if you would like assistance 
in the creation of a new interface.
