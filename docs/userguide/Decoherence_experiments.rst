Analysing Decoherence Experiments
==========================================

In Deer spectroscopy, decoherence experiments are an import step during setup. It is these experiments that allow one to choose the appropriate delay times,
and to get an estimate of the time required to achieve a certain signal to noise ratio (SNR). It is important to note however, that they do not provide
information on modulation depth and subsequently we can not gain information about the more important modulation to noise ratio (MNR).



2D Decoherence
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The use of 2D Decoherence in four pulse Deer was first proposed by Bahrenberg et. al. in [1]_, here we continue this work and expand it slightly. 

A 2D decoherence experiment takes the form of a carr-purcell 3 pulse experiment, where the two pulse delays are varied independently.
