Welcome to autoDeer's documentation!
====================================

autoDeer is a free software package for the running of automated Deer and other pulsed EPR expeiements on Bruker spectrometers. It also automates the analysis of EPR expeierments,
to calculate the optimal paramaters for future experiments.

.. warning:: 
    autoDeer is an actively developed software package, that is still very much a work in process. At this moment in time we only recomened it is used by people who understand how
    the python code work and can debug when it goes wrong. Please consider this to be an Alpha release, it is hoped that a more stable Beta version can be released soon.
