Semi - autoDEER
===============


What is a semi-autoDEER experiemnt?
-----------------------------------
A semi-autoDEER experiemnt is an autoDEER experiemnt run inside a Jupyter 
notebook where each sub-experiment is run individually this allows an experianced
user to intercede and take control when necessary or provide slight modifications
to the script. It has the same form and layout to a fully autoDEER experiment. 


Setup Experiments
-----------------
Before we can run DEER we must first conduct some setup expierments. These are:

1. Field Sweep
2. Resonator Profile
3. Inversion Recovery
